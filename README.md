# Numerical-methods-for-students
Consists of *.ipynb files prepared for the univesity course Numerical methods

All the documents were prepared with Google Colaboratory to provide the better accessibility of Ukrainian students to these files. Using this approach students can watch, edit files and conduct calculations even by their phones.

The repository is under development.
Topics that are in the course:
1. Nonlinear equations. Systems of equations.
2. Basics of the functions approximation. Interpolation and regression.
3. Optimization.
4. Monte-Carlo methods. Numerical integration.
5. Numerical methods for ODE solving.
6. Numerical methods for PDE solving.
7. Basic concepts of AI.

Task 1.1.
Solve the nonlinear equation using all the proposed methods. Study the nethods convergence. Make conclusions regarding the methods' pros and cons, provide your oqn recommendations for using the methods for solving nonlinear equations.

Task 1.2.
a. Solve the system of three nonlinear equations using the Newton, simple Newton method, and method of simple iterations. Make conclusions regarding the methods' pros and cons, provide your oqn recommendations for using the methods for solving systems of nonlinear equations.
b. Consider the system of linear equations with diagonally dominant matrix of coefficients. Study how time of exexution of method (both Gauss and simple iterations) depend on the number of equations/
